## The build

![Enclosure Case](images/enclosure%20case.png)

#### I reused a simple case that I had already and as chance would have it, the radar module fit inside it, barely but it fits! I chose an ESP MCU from Adafruit that's tiny so that it would nicely tuck in behind the radar module and also because the plug makes this a bit of a bulky, not easy to stack, build... and using an ESP8266 module would have made it difficult to keep the build small

#### For now I used the small bit of foam that was shipped with the radar module pressed into it to isolate the two modules and help prevent any contact that would short things out
