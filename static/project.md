# The build

![Enclosure Case](images/enclosure%20case.png)

### I reused a simple case that I had already and as chance would have it, the radar module fit inside it, barely but it fits! I chose an ESP MCU from Adafruit that's tiny so that it would nicely tuck in behind the radar module and also because the plug makes this a bit of a bulky, not easy to stack, build... and using an ESP8266 module would have made it difficult to keep the build small.
